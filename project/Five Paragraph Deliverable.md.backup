### Proposed Projects for MSSA Project

First, it is an honor to a part of MSSA Cohort 5. I hope to become well versed in all of the languages we will learn. My full name is Ryen Andre Lacquement, but I go by my middle name. I was born in Las Vegas, Nevada and raised in Austin, Texas where I hope to return and work in the software development industry. My hopes for my project are to provide something in the form a phone application that would simplify the lives of its users. My project ideas:

*  A phone application that would allow you to organize projects. It could be used by students and small business owners that are the masters of their own schedule. Users would be able to enter upcoming projects, assignments, etc. They would then be able to prioritize them, give projected completion dates, and set reminders for them to complete their projects.
	
* An application that interacted with other applications on your phone. The purpose would be purely for organization as the app would allow you to sort all of your existing and new apps into categories as you download them. 

* A application to create on-the-fly invoices that could be used by small business owners to generate professional invoices from their phones. It would have data entry points that were connecting with a professional invoice and as you enter data it would automatically start forming a .pdf that could be accessed at a later time.

I'm sure that as the weeks go by in this cohort that it will be clear to me which program and which language I would like to use to build these applications. I will also research similar, existing, applications that may give me some inspiration as to software and ideas for a friendly UI.
